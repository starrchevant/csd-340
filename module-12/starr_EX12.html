            <div class="card-title">Watching the NBA</div>

            <div class="card-content">
                Basketball is a hobby that has stayed consistent throughout my life and taught me a great deal about life. I share this moment because it was the first NBA game I ever attended and it happened to be in Beijing, China. In this short clip from 2016, I got to see Anthony Davis while he was still playing for the New Orleans  Pelicans and James Harden still playing for the Huston Rockets. Basketball is about a lot of things and this was pure fun.

            <div class="card-content">
                This is a hobby I began to enjoy with my wife. Our first dates seem to grow in distance every time we went out. Our adventures have taken us to some amazing places and some that I can say we won’t be back anytime soon. Now that we have children those adventures are even more exciting and full. As a kid when you watch movies like Home alone or the like I wanted to be that kid on the adventure. Now as an adult I am just trying not to be those parents.

            <div class="card-content">
                I know that is a very broad term for a hobby, but I love to be entertained and appreciate skill performers. I’ve been around a few and in fact, I was in a film that never made its way to the silver screen, but the experience was one in a million. As a matter of fact I have a daughter who has been bitten by the acting bug of sorts and every chance I get I have the popcorn ready kick back and enjoy.
